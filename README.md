## How to use:

Create a ProbabilityComputer with the following options:
- Deck: A base deck (You can crete a new one in the Deck directory)
- Engine: An engine used to simulate player decisions, it has both a goal and a discard policy

run computer.run() to get the results. 

Enjoy!


## Current Ideas:
